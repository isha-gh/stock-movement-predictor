# Stock Movement Predictor

## Project Overview

The **Stock Movement Predictor** is a multi-modal deep learning project designed to predict the next-day movement of stock prices (Up, Down, Neutral) by combining:

- **Historical stock price data** processed through PyTorch models using LSTM and CNN architectures for time series forecasting.
- **Financial news headlines** encoded with Transformer models (like BERT) to extract rich semantic information.
- **Semantic and sentiment embeddings** generated by querying a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to assess the market impact of news headlines.

By fusing time series price features and advanced NLP-based news embeddings, this model aims to provide a more accurate prediction of stock price direction, leveraging both quantitative and qualitative data.
